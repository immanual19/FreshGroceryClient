5. After the user logins with his/her Facebook/Google account, the Login button at top right corner becomes an avatar face. The login state is permanent. It means even if you reload, close the tab or shut down your device, you will remain signed in to FreshGrocery's website. To logout from FreshGrocery's website, simply click on that avatar face.
