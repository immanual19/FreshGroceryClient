# Introduction

1. This project is called FreshGrocery.
2. It can be referred as the most simplest version of an e-commerce site.
3. User must login with his/her Facebook/Google account to access all the facilities FreshGrocery has to offer.
4. I (A. Immanual Sarker) own everything of this website (https://full-stack-client-immanual19.web.app/) except product photos and design idea.
5. This project was developed for educational purpose only.

# Development Summary

1. In frontend, I have used React, Material UI, FontAwesome, React-Bootstrap.
2. In backend, I have used Node, MongoDB and Express.

# Please Notice

1. After an user logins with his/her Facebook/Google account, the Login button at top right corner becomes an avatar face. The login state is permanent. It means even if you reload, close the tab or shut down your device, you will remain logged in to FreshGrocery's website. To logout from FreshGrocery's website, simply click on that avatar face.

2. Each and every Database functionality is working fine. I have checked all of them on several occassions and I haven't found any bug. However, administrative access is given to every logged in user for now. So, if you do not see any product lists on home directory, then, one or several or all the products may have been deleted by any user. In that case, go to https://full-stack-client-immanual19.web.app/admin (login required) and add a product. You will notice that your product is showing on the home (https://full-stack-client-immanual19.web.app/) directory.

3. In future, administrative access will be given to vendors and website maintainance personnel only. Users/buyers will have access to all the necessary features.
